README

These files plot the locus of folds in the mu-alpha plane for the perturbed May-Leonard system. We do this for two values of beta, beta=0.5 and beta=1.5.

List of files:


1. Foldmu2.m

This file contains the MATLAB script for plotting locus of folds. It uses the files from folder Data to plot the this curve.


List of Folders:

1. mlm_mu_fold_beta_1_5

This folder contains files and AUTO07 routines for creating some of the data-files listed in folder Data. The data files created with these scripts contain lists of parameter values, alpha and mu, that correspond to a fold bifurcation when beta = 1.5.


2. mlm_mu_fold_beta_0_5

This folder contains files and AUTO07 routines for creating some of the data-files listed in folder Data. The data files created with these scripts contain lists of parameter values, alpha and mu, that correspond to a fold bifurcation when beta = 0.5.



3. Data

This folder contains files with the list of parameter values, alpha and mu, that correspond to locus of fold bifurcations.
