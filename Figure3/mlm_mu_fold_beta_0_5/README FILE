README FILE

These files compute locus of fold bifurcation in the mu-alpha plane for the May-Leonard with mutations. We find 3 curves of folds: Bottom, top-left, top-right. Value of beta = 0.5 

List of files:

1. mlm.f90

This file contains the equations, initial parameter values, and initial fixed point from which to start continuation for the bottom curve and the top-left curve. Initial fixed point was found using MATLAB fsolve.

2. mlm2.f90

This file contains the equations, initial parameter values, and initial fixed point from which to start continuation for the top-right curve. Initial fixed point was found using MATLAB fsolve.


3. c.mlm.3

This file contains the parameters fed to AUTO to carry out the continuation, including arc-length step size.


4. mlm.auto

This file carries out the routines to compute the locus of fold bifurcations.


Output: 3 CSV files which list the parameter values alpha mu that correspond to locus of folds for fixed value of beta = 0.5.
 

Output files:

1. Foldmu_beta_0_5_R.csv

2. Foldmu_beta_0_5_TL.csv

3. Foldmu_beta_0_5_TR.csv
