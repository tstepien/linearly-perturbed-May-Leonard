README FILE

These files compute locus of fold bifurcation for the May-Leonard with mutations. 
Steady states that emerge have components that are all positive.

List of files:

1. mlm.f90

This file contains the equations, initial parameter values, and initial fixed point from which to start continuation. Initial fixed point was found using MATLAB fsolve.

2. c.mlm.3

This file contains the parameters fed to AUTO to carry out the continuation, including arc-length step size.

3. mlm.auto

This file carries out the routines to compute the locus of fold bifurcations


Output: CSV file 'Cusp.csv' which lists the parameter values alpha beta that correspond to locus of folds.
