README

These files plot solutions of the perturbed May-Leonard system for parameter values that are on Region C' (the Hopf bifurcation line) of the stability diagram.
 
List of files:

1. derivMLmu.m

This is an M-function representing the linearly-perturbed May-Leonard system, that is May-Leonard with the mu term.

2. MLmu.m

This is an M-file that runs a MATLAB differential equation solver (ode45) using the derivML function, then plots the solution. For parameters, alpha is chosen first then beta is calculated using the line equation.
