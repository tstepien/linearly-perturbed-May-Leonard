README

This folder contains files for computing continuation curve for equilibria that bifurcate from fold. Parameters beta and mu are fixed, while alpha is varied. Output helps us plot m1-component of fixed point vs alpha parameter.

List of files:

1. mlm.f90

This file contains the equations, initial parameter values, and initial fixed point from which to start continuation. Initial fixed point was found using MATLAB fsolve.

2. c.mlm.3

This file contains the parameters fed to AUTO to carry out the continuation, including arc-length step size.

3. eq.auto

This file carries out the routines to compute the continuation curve for fixed beta, mu, and varying alpha


Output: CSV file 'Alpha2.csv' which lists the components of the fixed point vs alpha parameter.
