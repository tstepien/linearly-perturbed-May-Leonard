README FILE

These files compute the locus of fold bifurcation of the May-Leonard model with mutations in the alpha-beta plane. The set of points found correspond to the second half of the curve labeled 1) in Figure 4 of the paper. Steady states that emerge have at least one negative component. 

List of files:

1. mlm.f90

This file contains the equations, initial parameter values, and initial fixed point from which to start continuation. Initial fixed point was found using MATLAB fsolve.

2. c.mlm.3

This file contains the parameters fed to AUTO to carry out the continuation, including arc-length step size.

3. mlm.auto

This file carries out the routines to compute the locus of fold bifurcations


Output: CSV file 'Cusp3.csv' which lists the parameter values alpha beta that correspond to locus of folds.
