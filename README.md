The code contained in the linearly-perturbed-May-Leonard project was developed to numerically simulate the May-Leonard three-species competition model with an added linear perturbation term that can be interpreted as a model for "global mutations," where each of the three species can mutate into the other two with the same constant rate. It is described in:

Stepien](https://github.com/tstepien/), Dynamics of a linearly-perturbed Mayâ€“Leonard competition model, Submitted to the *Journal of Nonlinear Science*.
