README

These files plot a trajectory of the perturbed May-Leonard system for parameter values that are inside Region B of the stability diagram and that are also near the locus of fold bifurcations.

List of files:


1. mayleonard.m

This is an M-file containing the vector field corresponding to the perturbed May-Leonard system as well as its derivative map. The file is written as a MATLAB function. Inputs are the coordinates of a fixed point, alpha, beta, and mu. Outputs are the vector field and derivative map evaluated at said fixed point with given parameter values.

2. mayloenardode.m

This is an M-file containing the vector field corresponding to the perturbed May-Leonard system. It is written as a MATLAB function. Inputs are the (dummy) time, coordinates of a point, alpha, beta, and mu. Output is the vector field evaluated at said point with given parameter values.

3. FindingRoots.m

This is an M-file containing script for plotting trajectory of perturbed May-Leonard in the m1-m2 plane, as well as the m1-component vs time.
