README

These files plot simulations of the cylindrical coordinates system for the May-Leonard system with mutations.

List of files:

---------------------------------------
Programs
---------------------------------------

1. solve_fixedpt_muperturb_zero.m

Run this file to simulate the system with mu = mu_c = 0.0067.

2. solve_fixedpt_muperturb_medium.m

Run this file to simulate the system with mu = mu_c + 0.003 = 0.0697.

3. solve_fixedpt_muperturb_large.m

Run this file to simulate the system with mu = mu_c + 0.005 = 0.0717.
